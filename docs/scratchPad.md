## Chandelier Concept
Planning to create a parametric chandelier with the following features:
1. Core structure: Spiral arrangement of light points
2. Volumetric elements: Twisted geometric forms around the spiral
3. Parameters to control:
   - Overall height and width
   - Density of light points
   - Twist amount and direction
   - Individual volume sizes

## Component Setup Status
- Successfully created Python script file: chandelier_b718cf42-649b-4d9a-85e7-ca1d897613ca.py
- Component renamed to "Chandelier Generator"
- Input parameters configured:
  - height (Number)
  - radius (Number)
  - points_count (Integer)
  - twist_angle (Number)
  - volume_size (Number)
- Output parameters configured:
  - volumes (Generated volumetric elements)
  - points (Light point locations)
  - output (Script execution information)

Current Status:
- Component is properly configured with code reference
- Inputs need to be connected to receive data
- Default values are set in the code for all parameters
- Next steps:
  1. Connect number sliders to inputs
  2. Test the generation of the chandelier
  3. Potentially add more parameters for fine-tuning the design

## Light Web Component Added
Created a second component that generates organic connections between the chandelier points:
- Takes points from the chandelier component
- Creates organic tube connections between nearby points
- Features:
  1. Dynamic thickness based on distance and height
  2. Organic curves with random variations
  3. Ensures minimum connections per point
  4. Thicker connections near the bottom
  5. Curved pipes with variable radius

Parameters:
- max_distance: Controls how far points can connect (default 15.0)
- min_connections: Minimum connections per point (default 2)

The combination creates an interesting organic chandelier with a web of glowing connections between the main volumes.

## AI Rendering (2024-04-08)
Created a photorealistic rendering of the chandelier installation showing:
1. Spiral arrangement of black geometric volumes in a helix pattern
2. Organic golden light tubes connecting the volumes
3. Dynamic thickness variation in connections
4. Dramatic lighting effects with warm ambient glow
5. Contemporary architectural setting

The rendering is stored in `images/chandelier_render_2024_04_08.jpg`

The image captures the duality between geometric precision (boxes) and organic flow (light connections), demonstrating how the parametric design creates an elegant balance between structure and fluidity.
